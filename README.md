# Raider Legacy

![header-banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SugarF0x/raider/master/git/header-banner.jpg)

A passion-replica of _Dungeon Raid_ - an old and no longer updated smartphone game.

## Specification

This project uses `Nuxt.js` as its main framework. `Konva.js` with its native `Vue` support manages canvas.
The application is responsive and will adjust to every screen type at a ratio of 9:16.
The application can be interacted with on PC as well as on any smartphone.

## Current state of things

Here is a snapshot of what the current build looks like.
You can fiddle around with it yourself [here](http://raid.sugarfox.ru).
