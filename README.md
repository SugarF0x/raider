A passion-replica of _Dungeon Raid_ - an old and no longer updated smartphone game.

## Current state of things

Here is a snapshot of what the current build looks like.
You can fiddle around with it yourself [here](http://raid.sugarfox.ru).

I have moved on to other projects for this one is complete mess and sometimes im ashamed of looking at the sourcecode
i wrote myself. Perhaps, one day i will return to working on it, but the chances are, should I ever have an urge to
reignite the project's hearth, it will be yet another from-scratch rework on Godot

$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
